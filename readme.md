Assorted sound experiments

1. [Frequency ratio explorer](https://audio-lab.github.io/audio-experiment/ratio-explorer) — how does different frequency ratios sound like?
1. [Melodic circle](https://audio-lab.github.io/audio-experiment/mel-circle) — how does sequential ratios sound like?
1. [SVG synth](https://audio-lab.github.io/audio-experiment/svgsynth) — how does SVG shape like square, triangle or star, being rotated like a circle, sound like?
1. [Trianglifier](https://audio-lab.github.io/audio-experiment/trianglifier) — how does connecting signal extremums with lines sounds like? Like some overdrive actually.
1. [Spectrum-painter](https://audio-lab.github.io/audio-experiment/stft-painter) — test if gaussial spectrum painted in STFT sounds similar to noise with filter. (that does sound similar).
